### About

ReHeaT is a user friendly portal to explore, analyze and download the
transcriptional consensus signature of human end-stage heart failure
(HF-CS).

The HF-CS is based on a
[meta-analysis](http://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.019667) of 16
independent studies. Corresponding code is available
[here](https://github.com/saezlab/HF_meta-analysis).

### How to access

There are basically three ways of how to access ReHeaT:

-   You can access a live version running
    [here](https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/reheat/) on the server from
    `shinyapps.io`.

-   You can run the app locally in an interactive R session. Before make
    sure you have all packages installed listed in
    [`sub/global.R`](https://github.com/saezlab/reheat/blob/master/sub/global.R).

``` r
shiny::runGitHub("reheat", "saezlab")
```

-   You can run the app locally by cloning this repository. All required
    packages can be easily installed using the
    [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) package.

``` r
# install all required packages using the renv package
renv::restore()
shiny::runApp()
```
