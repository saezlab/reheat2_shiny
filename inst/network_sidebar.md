#### Multicellular network

<br>Explore the multicellular network of cell dependencies and communication.</br>
- **1. Select the network** you want to explore (below).
  - The edges represent cell type dependencies. 
- **2. Select an edge** of a directed cell type relationship. 
  - 2.1 Get an overview of possible ligand-receptor (LR) pairs that could mediate this edge.
  - 2.2 Prioritize ligands by assessing their expression score as well as their regulatory potential.
  - 2.3 See possible downstream target genes of these ligands.
