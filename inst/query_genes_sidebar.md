#### Gene Query

<br>Select genes of interest below to explore their deregulation in heart failure.</br>
The following results will be displayed:

- **1. Bulk Transcriptomics Expression** of queried gene(s). 
  - 1.1  Expression Change: View the log fold change across 20 bulk studies.
  - 1.2 Statistical Significance: Fisher’s method p-value ranking shows the gene’s association with heart failure.
- **2. Single-Nucleus Transcriptomics Expression** of queried gene(s). 
  - 2.1  Cell Type Marker Status: Determine if the queried gene serves as a cell-type marker.
  - 2.2 Multicellular Program Participation: Assess whether the gene is part of the multicellular heart failure program within cell types.
- **3. Conclusion:** 
  - 3.1 Gain insights into a gene’s deregulation in heart failure. A gene that aligns with the consensus signature from bulk data may reflect distinct expression patterns across cell types.
